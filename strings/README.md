#miscellaneous algorithms - adopting cats and dogs 11/7
I worked with my teammate to figure out a solution that involves two queues. The way the app should work is that once there are cats and dogs added to the adoption center, you can only adopt the one that is at the 
front of the line by dequeuing. If you specify cat, you get the cat at the front. If dog, you get the dog at the front. If you are not picky, you get the animal that enqueued first.

#hanoi towers 11/6
We spent the most of our time on trying to test out this particular algorithm. First we started with a group of three numbers, then four, then five. That alone was a fairly extensive andrew lengthy process. We had to backtrack often in order to optimize our moves. 

#rotating a matrix counter clockwise 11/2
I learned how this algorithm works by drawing it out in detail on the whiteboard. My teammate and I broke up our 4x4 square into 4 squares of 2x2. We then split up this process one step at a time.
We used geeks for geeks as a resource. This problem was practically impossible to understand before we drew it out. 

#2D/multdimensional array 11/1
I learned that you can set up a 2D array by initializing how many spaces are available, separated by a comma.
I used the resource provided in the class repo. I also got assistance from our new TA, Caleb.

#associative array 10/31
I learned that an associative array consists of key-value pairs.
I felt like there were not a lot of online resources available. THe link provided in the class repo explained what it is but not how to implement.
I looked at stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27469768/create-a-dictionary-using-array-of-object
We used the idea of a movie rental company as inspiration. Our key-value pair consisted of a movie rented and the person renting it.

#radix sort 10/25
the radix sort was espedially difficult to grasp initially. I referred to the website provided provided in the class repo for instruction. First we wrote out the problem, then 
planned our next steps on the white board.

#merge sort 10/24
George and I received help in conceptualizing how to attack this problem from Nathan. We referred to https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Merge_sort for visualzation of the 
problem. Besides that, we worked everything out together.

#insertion_sorting_of_array
We looked at the website that was recommended in our class repo.
George and I worked it ouot without the aid of any notes.

#animal_game 10/20
-I learned that this game takes a lot of planning and thought. My team started with a diagra of our tree and the the questions that would come next based on the user's answer.
-We used this website for guidance: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/4a950c/20-questions-guessing-game-using-binary-trees/

#array_binary_search_tree
I found this a worthy challenge and I started by researching arrays to binary search trees. My group drew out a diagram
as well and I understand a lot more about this data structure now. I could always benefit from additional instruction though.
We used the geeks for geeks website as a reference.

#binary search tree deletion
We used the geeks for geeks website as a reference. They had an example in Java. 
I couldn't find any way to use string interpolation to display the number that was deleted.

#min-max-binary-search-tree 10/17
I referred to this site for help: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-minimum-element-in-a-binary-search-tree/. I quickly grasped the idea that minimum would be the same as left-most and maximum would be the same as right-most.

#binary-tree-traversal 10/16
I referred to this site for help: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/binary_search_tree.htm. I also got assistance from Lynn. I'm not sure that my tree is printing correctly. I don't really understand what I did.

#breadth-first traversal
We used https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/tree/breadth-first/ for guidance. I learned today that trees are made up of two child nodes and a head. Imagine that!

#in-order traversal and post-order traversal 10/4
I had trouble getting my tree to print in a different order. I continue to struggle with these data structure assignments. I understand that we pretty much only have to adjust the position of
the Console.WriteLine but I can't seem to get this working.

#preordered traversal of binary tree 10/3
This assignment took an hour to complete. We benefited from the help of our TA, Nathan, and learned the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

#two stacks and a queue 9/28
My partner and I took our time laying out a plan and implementing it. In the end, we were still stuck on how to get things working. I'm submitting what I have.

# doubly-linked list palindrome test 9/27
I am still having a very difficult time understanding these code challenges. I'm having trouble understanding their relevance and feel that I will greatly benefit from further study of 
the subject. I'm considering buying a copy of Cracking the Code. "Feeling it out" isn't how I'm comfortable learning.

# data-structures 9/21
We have had trouble getting this one working. We came across a lot of problems.

# data-structures 9/19
We got off to a much smoother start in this lab.
We first reviewed the code for the singly linked list code challenge.
After setting up the new folder for lab 2, we turned to the whiteboard.
We asked our peers for assistance when we were stuck.

# data-structures 9/18
We took the majority of our code from Stack Overflow and codeproject.com
We had a lot of difficulty getting this particular code challenge off the ground.
We had to resort to code tutorials and other helpful sites to get through this.
We would benefit from a more in-depth look at linked lists. Hands-on isn't all that helpful in this case.
