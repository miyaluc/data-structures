#two stacks and a queue 9/28
My partner and I took our time laying out a plan and implementing it. In the end, we were still stuck on how to get things working. I'm submitting what I have.

# doubly-linked list palindrome test 9/27
I am still having a very difficult time understanding these code challenges. I'm having trouble understanding their relevance and feel that I will greatly benefit from further study of 
the subject. I'm considering buying a copy of Cracking the Code. "Feeling it out" isn't how I'm comfortable learning.

# data-structures 9/21
We have had trouble getting this one working. We came across a lot of problems.

# data-structures 9/19
We got off to a much smoother start in this lab.
We first reviewed the code for the singly linked list code challenge.
After setting up the new folder for lab 2, we turned to the whiteboard.
We asked our peers for assistance when we were stuck.

# data-structures 9/18
We took the majority of our code from Stack Overflow and codeproject.com
We had a lot of difficulty getting this particular code challenge off the ground.
We had to resort to code tutorials and other helpful sites to get through this.
We would benefit from a more in-depth look at linked lists. Hands-on isn't all that helpful in this case.
