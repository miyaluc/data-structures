We took the majority of our code from Stack Overflow and codeproject.com
We had a lot of difficulty getting this particular code challenge off the ground.
We had to resort to code tutorials and other helpful sites to get through this.
We would benefit from a more in-depth look at linked lists. Hands-on isn't all that helpful in this case.
